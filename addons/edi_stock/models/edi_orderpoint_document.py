    This is the base model for EDI minimum inventory rule documents.
    Each row represents a collection of EDI minimum inventory rule
    records that, in turn, each represent a minimum inventory rule
    that will be created or updated when the document is executed.

    All input attachments are parsed to generate a list of potential
    EDI minimum inventory rule records, represented in the form of a
    values dictionary that could be used to create the EDI minimum
    inventory rule record.

    Minimum inventory rule definitions typically change infrequently.
    To minimise unnecessary duplication, any EDI minimum inventory
    rule records that would not result in a new or modified
    ``stock.warehouse.orderpoint`` record will be automatically elided
    from the document.

    Derived models should implement either :meth:`~.prepare` or
    :meth:`~.orderpoint_record_values`.
