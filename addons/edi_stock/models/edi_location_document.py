    This is the base model for EDI location documents.  Each row
    represents a collection of EDI location records that, in turn,
    represent a location that will be created or updated when the
    document is executed.

    All input attachments are parsed to generate a list of potential
    EDI location records, represented in the form of a values
    dictionary that could be used to create the EDI location record.

    Location definitions typically change infrequently.  To minimise
    unnecessary duplication, any EDI location records that would not
    result in a new or modified ``location.location`` record will be
    automatically elided from the document.

    Derived models should implement either :meth:`~.prepare` or
    :meth:`~.location_record_values`.
