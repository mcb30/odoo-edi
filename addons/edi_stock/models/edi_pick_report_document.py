    """EDI stock transfer report document

    This is the base model for EDI stock transfer report documents.
    Each row represents two collections of EDI records:

    - a collection of EDI stock transfer report records that, in turn,
      each represent a stock transfer that will be reported upon when
      the document is executed, and

    - a collection of EDI stock move report records that, in turn,
      each represent a collection of line items within the above stock
      transfers

    Note that it is reasonably common for stock transfer report
    documents to aggregate multiple underlying ``stock.picking``
    and/or ``stock.move`` records.  For example: a stock transfer
    report document may specify the total quantity of each product
    dispatched, even if the stock was fetched from multiple warehouse
    locations.  For this reason, an EDI stock move report record may
    represent multiple stock transfer line items, and is not directly
    associated with a single EDI stock transfer report record.

    Derived models should implement :meth:`~.move_report_list` and
    :meth:`~.execute`, and may choose to implement
    :meth:`~.pick_report_domain` and :meth:`~.move_report_domain`.
