    This is the base model for EDI product documents.  Each row
    represents a collection of EDI product records that, in turn,
    represent a product that will be created or updated when the
    document is executed.

    All input attachments are parsed to generate a list of potential
    EDI product records, represented in the form of a values
    dictionary that could be used to create the EDI product record.

    Product definitions typically change infrequently.  To minimise
    unnecessary duplication, any EDI product records that would not
    result in a new or modified ``product.product`` record will be
    automatically elided from the document.

    Derived models should implement either :meth:`~.prepare` or
    :meth:`~.product_record_values`.
